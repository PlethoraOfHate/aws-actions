# aws-actions README

This is a pretty straightforward extension. It adds autocomplete to yaml/json files of all the AWS "actions" that are available as of 09.18.2018

This was created because I didn't want to memorize every. single. action.

## Features

Simply start typing an action and the autocomplete box will display options which you can scroll through and select.

## Release Notes
